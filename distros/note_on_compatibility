Redhat 7,8

Redhat provides base docker images via its own repo at registry.access.redhat.com.
The Universal Base Images (UBI) are freely available (ubi7, ubi8) and included
access to UBI-specific repositories. But Globus requires libnice.so.10 which is
in the rhui repo which is not included in the UBI repos. So until we find a
workaround, there's no Dockerfile based on RHEL.
